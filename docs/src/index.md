# Employee Care Anywhere Documentation


This page showcases the various elements and features presented on Employee Care Anywhere Application. The database schema [can be consulted on this external lucidchart diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/0bf0bd46-9dae-417f-b388-f6ac51f27c84/edit?invitationId=inv_cd9546fa-cb98-4003-8ab6-338a65a8660f).

This was my first, and probably largest, PowerApps project, so some sections may be more optimized than others. I decided to categorize the database into four main types: **Employees**, **Clients**, **Tickets** and **Administrative**. So far, the Employees and Tickets sections are the most complex, as they also rely on PowerAutomate flows to function.

    All of this documentation is my own work, but I used AI tools such as ChatGPT to reword a few sentences, check grammar, and make everything easier to read.
